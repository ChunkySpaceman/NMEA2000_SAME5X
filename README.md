# NMEA2000_SAME5X
WIP: A Library to allow the M4 CAN SAME5X board to communicate with the NMEA2000 library.

You will also need the m4 can library from Adafruit found here: https://github.com/adafruit/arduino-CAN
and the NMEA2000 library found here: https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000
and at present you will need to modify the NMEA2000 library until the m4 is added.
